# Store

Complete guide to the 'store' functionality.

## Introduction

Store acts as the gateway between raw data and rtvals. It's main purpose is creating those rtvals according to 
user setup. So it's best to read the rtvals doc before this one. 

At the moment there are three slightly different uses of store
- Inside a stream node, to process simple stream data
- Inside a path node, to process stream data after filter/math/edit operations
- As the rtvals node, to create rtvals that aren't directly linked to stream/path data

As usual, an overview of all available commands can be obtained using `store:?`.

## Inside a stream node

### Simple direct data
Suppose there's stream that continuously outputs the humidity and nothing more.  
```xml
<stream id="meteo" type="tcp">
    <eol>crlf</eol>
    <address>localhost:4000</address>
</stream>
```
````
45
44
43
43
````
To create the store: `store:meteo,addint,humidity`. 
```xml
<stream id="meteo" type="tcp">
    <eol>crlf</eol>
    <address>localhost:4000</address>
    <store>
        <int unit="%">humidity</int> <!-- unit isn't actually needed -->
    </store>
</stream>
```
This would result in the humidity being stored in an int with id `meteo_humidity`.

But the above would have actually been read like this:
```xml
<stream id="meteo" type="tcp">
    <eol>crlf</eol>
    <address>localhost:4000</address>
    <store group="meteo" map="false" db="" delimiter=","> <!-- group is taken from the id of the stream, ',' is the default delimiter -->
        <int index="0" unit="%">humidity</int> <!-- Index is the position after split on the delimiter -->
    </store>
</stream>
```
* Index is not required, as long as there's no doubt.  
If there are two or more elements after the split and the store contains the same amount of val's, no indexes need to be provided.
Whether to include indexes in that case depends on user preference.
* map will be explained in the section 'Multiline key:value pair data'
* db is for writing to databases and will be covered in 'extras'

### Delimited data

If instead the data would look like this  
hum:48  
The store would be created with (check `store:?` for syntax):

* To add an integer: `store:meteo,addint,humidity,1`  
* To alter the delimiter to : `store:meteo,delimiter,:`

```xml
<stream id="meteo" type="tcp">
    <eol>crlf</eol>
    <address>localhost:4000</address>
    <store group="meteo" delimiter=":"> <!-- group is taken from the id of the stream, ',' is the default delimiter -->
        <int index="1" unit="%">humidity</int> <!-- Index is the position after split on the delimiter -->
        <!-- For now % must be entered manually -->
    </store>
</stream>
```

### Multiline key:value pair data

If the data is multiline `key:value` pairs for example:  
hum:45
temp:22.5
winddir:320

> Note: The delimiter doesn't have to be ':', it can be any character sequence. But no regex (for now).

For this the `map` feature is used.
* Switch to map mode: `store:meteo,map,yes` (or true,1,high)
* Alter the delimiter `store:meteo,delimiter,:`
* Add the humidity `store:meteo,addint,humidity,hum`
* Add the temperature `store:meteo,addreal,temperature,temp`
* Add the winddirection `store:meteo,addint,winddir,winddir`

(units need to be filled in manually in the xml)
```xml
<stream id="meteo" type="tcp">
    <eol>crlf</eol>
    <address>localhost:4000</address>
    <store map="true" group="meteo" delimiter=":"> <!-- Pairs are separated with ':' -->
        <int key="hum" unit="%">humidity</int>  <!-- if the key of the pair is hum, store the value in humidity -->
        <real key="temp" unit="째C">temperature</real>
        <int key="winddir" unit="째">winddir</int>
    </store>
</stream>
```
The order of the val's doesn't have to match the sequence in which they arrive.

### Extras

**Writing to a database**

The write values to a database the `db` attribute is used.  
The format is db="dbid:dbtable" multiple dbid's can be provided separated with a ','.

What this does, is trigger an insert into the specified tables when the last val in the store is updated.  
This is why it might be important for key:pair data that the last pair received is also the last in the store.  
Otherwise old and new data might get mixed.

To give a simple example:
````xml
<databases>
    <sqlite id="meteo" path="db\meteodata.sqlite">
      <table name="meteo"> <!-- d20s instead of dice -->
        <utcnow>timestamp</utcnow>
        <integer>humidity</integer>
          <integer>winddir</integer>
          <real>temperature</real>
      </table>
    </sqlite>
</databases>
<streams>
    <stream id="meteo" type="tcp">
        <eol>crlf</eol>
        <address>localhost:4000</address>
        <store map="true" db="meteo:meteo" delimiter=":"> 
            <int key="hum" unit="%">humidity</int> 
            <real key="temp" unit="째C">temperature</real>
            <int key="winddir" unit="째">winddir</int> <!-- Receiving this key will trigger the table insert -->
        </store>
    </stream>
</streams>
